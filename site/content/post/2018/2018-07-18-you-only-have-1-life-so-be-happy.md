So many people waste their time, by doubting about everything!

<!--more-->

But all your choices shouldn’t be a waste of time! Choose what makes you happy!

If you have to choose between job, pick what makes your happy!

If you have to pick food, pick what makes you happy!

If you have to pick an education, pick what makes you happy!

Do it!

And if your not sure what makes you happy, try things out! Don’t be scared if it doesn’t work out as you expected!

Don’t be affraid to fail! Because it would be a failure if your regret at 80–90 years old, that you didn’t tried this or that!

Focus on happyness, because that’s gonna make sure you will stick to it!
