Let’s start with the first tip!

## 1: Put yourself in positions where you are not the expert

- So you are forced to learn new things
- In the comfort zone you don’t learn anything
- Tip number two!

## 2: Give yourself time to learn
- Think about when a baby start laying
- Then crawling
- Then sitting
- And then walking
- Still following me?

##  3: Keep in mind that you don’t compare yourself with experienced people
- It’s not fair to compare yourself with people who already improved their skill
- They have spend already a lot more time then you
- We are over the half

## 4: You have to fail in order to fail!
- Like a small kid tries to walk it will fall
- But you have to try again, again and again
- When failing you find also many ways that don’t work
- Are you ready for the latest tip?

## 5: Start simple and then optimise!
- Start with trying out
- Try more things out
- And after that optimise

This is what I learned most from the Agile mind set when working in software development

I hope that you can use some of the tips from this video in your daily life.
