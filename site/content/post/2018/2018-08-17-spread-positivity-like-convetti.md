Yesterday, I was thinking, why do I make this videoâ€™s and put them online so everyone can see it?

<!--more-->

And the reason is, I have the feeling that I need to do this, must do this!

Itâ€™s feels like I canâ€™t keep it inside my mind anymore, it wants to come out and break out if I wonâ€™t do it!

Iâ€™m I the best motivator? Iâ€™m i the best storyteller? Maybe not! But who cares!

If there is just only 1 persons mind motivated or encouraged by these words Iâ€™m happy that I didnâ€™t keep it for myself!

This is not about me, this is me caring about others and plant dose of positivity in peopleâ€™s mind so the can go through a tough time! Thatâ€™s my goal!

So If you need some positive motivation on something in your life, please DM me via Instagram!

Because I love to spread positivity like itâ€™s confetti! And you know the thing with confetti, it comes everywhere. Even on places you wouldnâ€™t expect it. Sometimes you will find it after months ðŸ˜‰

Know that you are worth it! Even if you donâ€™t feel like it, even if other people tell you otherwise!

But you are here for a reason! Even if your parents didnâ€™t planned you! You are here for a reason!

You are put on this world to be a wonderful human with itâ€™s passion, character and craziness,

Do what feels right! Choose what feels right! If works for you, then continue! If it doesnâ€™t, that change it fast!

But you are a wonderful human with a important purpose!

Enjoy life, feel it, breath it, take risks, love others!
