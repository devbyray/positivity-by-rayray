## Agile

Agile means flexible of course, but the Agile way of working comes from the software development industry. Because I work as a developer, all of the things approach is with an Agile Mindset.

## Agile Mindset

The Agile Mindset is not only usable in the software development industries. Because it is a mindset we can use it in our daily lives and that is fantastic.

## Break things into smaller pieces

With an Agile approach, you try to make big things smaller. If you want to eat a pizza your just gonna cut it into pieces, because it is hard to it a pizza just in one bite.

So when having big goals it is important that we divide those goals into smaller goals. Smaller goals are easier to fulfill in a shorter amount of time. It will probably be motivated to see you're progressing each time bit by bit.
