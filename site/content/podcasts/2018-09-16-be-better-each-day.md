## It’s hard to become better

- A lot of people think that they are not good enough
- Compare themselves with other people
- What happens if you don’t see your own change
- What if you don’t see your own personal development
- That’s a depressing feeling

## Everyday 1% better than yesterday

- This is such an enlightenment
- 1% better every day is easy
- focus on just a little bit better
- after a year you became 365% so that is huge
- this is a real mindset and mind shift
