In this episode, I want to talk with you about being or feeling ready. Most of us intend to start doing something new until we are ready.

But the thing is, we are never gonna reach that point. We first need to take action in order to reach the point to be ready.

The experts of this world all started with something at the point that they didn't feel ready. But they did start it anyway, so should you do!
